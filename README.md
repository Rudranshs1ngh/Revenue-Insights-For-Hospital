A Hospital noticed a loss in its market share and wanted to adress this issue.
To facilitate data-informed decision-making, I developed an end-to-end dashboard.
Using Power BI, I analysed data to track revenue by category, trends by key metrics, property performance, realization percentage, and several other KPIs
(Key Performance Indicators).
This dashboard enabled the Revenue team to regain their revenue and market share by 25% in next month.
